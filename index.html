											<h3>Text Analyzer
												<p>
													Worked with one of the contruction companies from London to develop a webapp. The objective was to analyse two different types of documents: Risks involved and mitigation of risks to determine the quality of mitigation documents. Used NLU (Natural Language Understanding) to use the keywords identified in the previous step to suggest missing risks on the webapp.
													Techologies used:
													<ul>
														<li>Python, Flask API framework</li>
														<li>Microservices like Docker to host the APIs and webapp</li>
														<li>IBM Watson Cloud</li>

								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Profile.jpg" align="left" alt="" /></a>

							<p>I'm a curious person by nature. That's how I got into data science. I first read this quote by Clive Humby that, "Data is the new oil" in 2016. I got so fascinated by the possibilities of using data analysis that I chose my minor as data science in last year of undergrad! I have never looked back! It's been almost 6 years now and I still get amazed by the different uses of data. My curiousity lead me to get into research and that's how I landed up my two patents while working full time in IBM. I was always working on side on some research project whhile working on projects on a daily basis! 

							Currently, I'm pursuing MSBA from UC Davis where I was given an opportunity to work part-time as a research assistant with two of the brilliant professors, Prof JÃ¶rn Boehnke and Prof Ashwin Arvindakshan. I;m currently working with them to analyse the effect of air quality index on the social disparities. This is my first academic research project and it has been an amazing journey full of learning!
